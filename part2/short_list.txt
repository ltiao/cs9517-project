High level plan?

1. SIFT feature tracking
    - Reuse existing code to stabilize videos
        > 1) around a particular given object
        > 2) dynamically detect in a given video an object (or background) to stabilize against

2. Lucas Kanade method    

3. Kalman Particle filtering
    - Use Kalman filter to detect and smooth motion.
    - 

Option B:
    - Read the Youtube paper and do video stabilization along proposed camera paths.
